This project aims to develop authentication methods with different security levels, ranging from 1 to 6.

- Libraries: 
    - express
    - body-parser

2. Install any necessary dependencies using `npm install`
3. Choose the security level you want to implement
4. Review the code for that security level in `app.js`
5. Implement the necessary changes to integrate the authentication method into your application
6. Start the server using `node app.js`

## Code Explanation
